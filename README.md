# geoscience-tools

Collection of tools and resources from around the web. I have tested/used some, but not all.

### Lists

- A list of opensource geoscience tools https://github.com/softwareunderground/awesome-open-geoscience#seismic-and-seismology

- A list of machine learning tools https://github.com/ESIPFed/Awesome-Earth-Artificial-Intelligence
### Geophysics

- Open geophysics tools https://geosci.xyz/#home

### Geospatial

- Preview geospatial data from inside VS Studio Code https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jumpinjackie.vscode-map-preview

### Geothermal

- Lectures in python and hot dry rock geothermal https://github.com/Japhiolite/geothermics (forked)

### Structure and Geomechnics

- Plot stereonets https://github.com/geoscience-tools/mplstereonet (forked)

- Mohr circles https://github.com/geoscience-tools/Tectonofluids (forked)

- Fitting Binigham distibutions on stereonets https://github.com/geoscience-tools/Bingham_distributions (forked)

- Scanline fracture survey processing (includes demo dataset) https://github.com/BatLep/SkaPy 

- Analysis of fracture maps stored as shapefiles (polylines or points): May be useful for lidar data interp https://github.com/TerminusEst/geo_frac_analysis 

- Analysis of fracture maps in Excel that uses endpoint coordiantes of lineaments (scanline, circular scanline and window sampling) https://github.com/ConnyZeeb/FraNEP

- Demo of image log fracture analysis https://github.com/geoscience-tools/fracture-SFA (forked)

- Recipes for structure analysis in python and R https://github.com/geoscience-tools/structural-geology-cookbook (forked)

### Wells

- Calculate/convert well survey data https://github.com/geoscience-tools/wellpathpy (forked, but under active dev so best use original)

- Handle well data (striplogs, formation tops, well log curves, and synthetic seismograms) https://github.com/geoscience-tools/welly (forked)

- Plot strip logs https://github.com/geoscience-tools/wellioviz (forked, but under dev so best use origional)

- Well design and trajectory planning https://github.com/geoscience-tools/welleng (forked, but under active dev so best use original)
